As of Alpha-1, there is no sequencer!
Yet you can compose tune thanks to the following:

# Implicit sequencing

Each phrase is automatically repeated.
When you edit the first occurrence of the phrase, any change will be reported to the subsequent iterations. 
More interestingly, when you edit an implicit repetition, this iteration is cloned to a new phrase, and this is this new phrase that will be repeated afterward.
