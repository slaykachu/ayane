Each row represents `step` ticks (6 by default).
/!\ In alpha1, we cannot change yet the step!

For each column, `-` represents an empty value, meaning the previous note (resp. instrument, volume) holds. 
To delete a non-empty value, use DEL.
To stop a note from playing use CLR.

Let's describe each column:

# Note
Press piano key to enter a note (from C-0 lowest pitch to F-( highest pitch).

You can also set a 0 period (for pure noise, pure hard envelope or pure sync buzzer), by pressing the key left to CLR:
* ^/£ on QWERTY
* -/_ on AZERTY
Using such a period leads to lower volume than clearing the `tone` flag in the instrument editor.

# Instrument
Decimal from 01 to 99.
When empty (--), the current instrument will keep playing (legato).

# Volume
In hexadecimal from 0 to F.
* 0 mutes (better use CLR in that case, unless you want to resume instrument playing)
* F is max
