Ayane comes with pre-loaded instruments you can inspect and edit.

To edit an instrument or create a new one (from 01 to 99), select it via CONTROL-I and arrows, then ENTER.
The following shortcuts are handled but deprecated.
* CONTROL-f3 (go to instrument editor -- starkos)
* f5/f8 (previous/next instrument -- Soundtrakker)

# Keys/shortcut

* Navigation
 * Cursor keys to navigate
 * CONTROL + Cursor keys to navigate faster
 * CONTROL-f0: First row
 * CONTROL-f.: Last row
* Edition
 * /!\ All values (except volume and hard env type) are decimal.
 * /!\ Numeric pad is not operational!
 * Space to toggle flip-flops
 * ENTER to insert a row
 * CONTROL-DEL to delete a row

# Instrument table description

An instrument consists of rows, one row per tick.
Each column has a dedicated role:

## Loop
Indicate the looping row after last row is reached.
If no loop is set, the instrument stop playing after the last row.

## Tone
Flip/flop. Set by default to generate the AY square tone.
Clearing it is usefull to play pure noise, pure hard env or timer fx alone.

## Volume
The AY volume in hexadecimal, for 0 (mute) to F (max).
Automatically disabled when hard env or sync-buzzer is used.

## Arp
Shift in semitone, from -63 to 63.
Only affects the AY square tone.
TODO: Clip instead of wrapping when out of range.

## Pitch
Shift in 1/16 of period. From -9999 to 9999.
Only affects the AY square tone.
A negative value will pitch down (internally, AY period is increased).
A positive value will pitch up (internally, AY period is decreased).

## Noise
Consist of a flag and a value.
* . -  No noise
* . n  No noise, but change R6 for side effect (expert)
* x 0  Noise, don't change R6  (expert)
* x n  Noise n 

Typically when you want noise, you'll use the last combination. By the way the flag is automaticaly set when you change the value, for convenience.

## Hard envelope
Let you modulate the volume / create special sounds.
Instead of specifying the volume at each tick, you might control it via an envelope (sawtooth, triangle...). That's the original purpose of the "Envelope Generator Control" AY register.
Yet for chiptune tracking on Amstrad, Atari, MSX, Spectrum, and <insert beloved old system here>, it is almost always exploited in another way. Instead of letting the envelope run slowly for a progressive change of volume (e.g. period of 3 seconds), it is programmed to run so fast it creates a sound waveform (e.g. period of 4.608 ms corresponding to 217Hz).
This clever usage is dubbed "buzzer" in the Atari Scene.
Since the original purpose was to control volume over long period of time, the unit is 16 times the one used for square tone periods. This implies two things:
* It is 16 times less precise, leading to out-of-tune notes, especially for higher pitches.
* It rarely matches the square tone period, leading to phase-shifting (an effect that is very welcomed, as it makes the timbre morph through time).

The column let you choose the kind of envelope:
```
0,1,2,3 \___ 4,5,6,7,F /___ 8 \\\\ 9 \___ A \/\/ 

                        ___           ___
                     B \    C //// D /    E /\/\
```

For the waveform to be audible, you must pick a self-repeating envelope (8, A, C or E).
