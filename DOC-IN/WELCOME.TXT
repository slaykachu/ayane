--- Known bugs ------------------------------
#6: Some spurious artefacts with timer FX
#4: C#4 PSG period rounded to 226 instead of 225
#3: Instrument editor is too slugish. Plus, sometimes screen flickers
#1: Timer FXs (sync-buzzer) dephasing relative to PSG square tone
    With pitch=0, no phase shifting should occur. Yet it does
    Mitigation: Deactivate PSG tone!
